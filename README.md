# Arabic Fake News Detection

This project aims to develop a system for detecting fake news in Arabic. The goal is to provide a tool that can help users identify and verify the authenticity of news articles and reports.


## Approach

We utilized LSTM neural networks to train the model for fake news detection. The LSTM model helps capture the sequential patterns in the text data, while the neural networks provide the necessary computational power for training and inference. 

## Results

Results show that the model can accurately predict whether a news article is fake or genuine with high accuracy. The system can help users identify and verify the authenticity of news articles and reports.
